	HTML is short for "HyperText Markup Language".

	Every web page is actually a HTML file. 
	Each HTML file is just a plain-text file, but with a .html file extension instead of .txt, and is made up of many HTML tags as well as the content for a web page.

	HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content.

	The <html> tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.

	The <html> tag 
	The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements 

	There are four sets of HTML tags that are needed to form the basic structure for every HTML file:

	1) <html></html> - represents the root of an HTML document.
	2) <head></head> - The header contains information about the document that will not appear on the actual page
	3) <title></title> - The title that will appear in the title bar of your web browser
	4) <body></body> - The body tags contain all the information and other visible content on the page.
