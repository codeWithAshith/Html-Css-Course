	CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document.

	CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed. 

	CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

	A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block.

	The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

	The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

	Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

	A CSS declaration always ends with a semicolon, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
