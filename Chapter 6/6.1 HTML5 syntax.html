<!-- 
   The DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 is very simple.
   The character encoding (charset) declaration is also very simple.
   The Unicode Consortium develops the Unicode Standard. Their goal is to replace the existing character sets with its standard Unicode Transformation Format (UTF).

   UTF-8 A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long. 
   UTF-8 can represent any character in the Unicode standard. 
   UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII. 
   UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages


   The most interesting new HTML5 elements are: 

   New semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>.
   New attributes of form elements like number, date, time, calendar, and range.
   New graphic elements: <svg> and <canvas>.
   New multimedia elements: <audio> and <video>.
   The most interesting new API's in HTML5 are:

   HTML Geolocation
   HTML Drag and Drop
   HTML Local Storage
   HTML Application Cache
   HTML Web Workers
   HTML SSE
